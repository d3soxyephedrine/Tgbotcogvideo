## Logo Integration

The HTML currently uses an SVG placeholder. To use your actual Ko2 logo:

### Quick Method
In `chat.html`, find these two lines (around line 287 and 328):

```html
<img src="data:image/svg+xml,..." alt="Ko2">
```

Replace with:
```html
<img src="/static/ko2-logo.png" alt="Ko2">
```

Then copy `ko2-logo.png` to your Flask static directory.

### Detailed Instructions
See `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for complete setup.

## Color Customization

Want to tweak the colors? Edit CSS variables at the top of `chat.html`:

```css
:root {
    --primary-cyan: #00d4ff;      /* Your brand color */
    --secondary-blue: #0099cc;     /* Secondary accent */
    --dark-bg: #0a0e1a;           /* Background */
}
```

## What Works Out of the Box

✅ All existing authentication
✅ Credit system display
✅ Message streaming
✅ Error handling
✅ API key modal
✅ Mobile responsive
✅ All original features

## Performance Notes

## The Vibe

Dark, powerful, tech-forward. The UI screams "unrestricted intelligence" - exactly what Ko2 represents. Every animation, every glow, every gradient reinforces that this isn't your typical sanitized chatbot.
